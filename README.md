# ABM
Agent based model framework to simulate collective foraging with visual private and social cues

## Introduction
This repository hold the code base for the agent based model framework implemented in python/pygame to model and simualate agents collectively foraging in the environment.

## Requirements
To run the simulations you will need python 3.8 or 3.9 and pip correspondingly. It is worth to set up a virtualenvironment using pipenv or venv for the project so that your global workspace is not polluted.

## Test
To test the code:
  1. Clone the repo
  2. Activate your virtual environment (pipenv, venv) if you are using one
  3. run `pip install -e .` with that you installed the simulation package
  4. run the start entrypoint of the simulation package by running `abm-start`
